# Before we start {-}

## What is this? {-}

## Why fix typos? {-}

* The maintainer will prefer a typo fix to a typo report. 
* It's low stakes. You are unlikely to break anything by fixing documentation, but it gives you practice contributing.
* You can improve the experience for the next person who uses the documentation.

## Warning {-}

Before trying any of this on someone else's package make sure you read the final chapter [Contributing in the Wild](#wild).
